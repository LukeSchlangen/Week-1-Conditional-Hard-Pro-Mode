# Week-1-Conditional-Hard-Pro-Mode

###This is my submission for the Week 1 Conditional Hard Pro Mode Challenge.  It contains a basic HTML page linked to a JavaScript file.  The JS file contains a function that will compare two values or strings.  It will find the number in a string, and compare that number to another number.  It will log messages saying, "The first number is bigger!", "The second number is bigger!", "The numbers are the same!".  The one bug I am still working on is when the number comes after a word in a string, it won't work.
